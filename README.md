* This tool was originally developed as the 3rd stage in a pipeline of `testssl.sh` automation, consuming the `testssl.sh` JSON output files produced by the [testssl.sh-processor daemon](https://github.com/bitsofinfo/testssl.sh-processor) available at https://github.com/bitsofinfo/testssl.sh-processor which is a tool to bulk test `testssl.sh` command files generated by another process, using a file monitoring watchdog.
